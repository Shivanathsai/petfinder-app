# petfinder-app

Webapp to find pets available for adoption based on desired location, animal, and breed. 

Uses [Petfinder.com](https://www.petfinder.com)'s API to show currently available pets.

Based on the exercise from [Brian Holt's Complete Intro to React v4 course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/). 

## Setup

1. Go [here](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key) to get your own API key and secret
2. Clone repo
3. Run `npm install` to get dependencies
4. Create a new file named .env in the root directory (same directory as the package.json file)
5. Add your API_KEY and API_SECRET from Petfinder.com to .env
6. Run `npm run dev` to build the app and start a local server to host it
